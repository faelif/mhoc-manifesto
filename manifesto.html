				<strong>To the people of Britain,</strong>
				<br  /><br  />
				As we approach the next General Election, the United Kingdom faces a choice. After the breakdown of the broad-right Coinflip government and the inaction of the subsequent Central Line, it is clear that there is only one way forward to a strong and compassionate Britain — the left. Regressive and backwards policy has been tested and shown to be inadequate, while the socialist and communist sections of the House of Commons have pushed forwards in leaps and bounds, working tirelessly on behalf of the British people.
				<br  /><br  />
				However, we must not become complacent. We may have progressed considerably over the past few terms but there is much that still needs to be done. And the old guard of parties, the Conservatives, Labour and the Liberal Democrats especially, cannot deliver what is required. Politics has grown stale and needs new voices, new figures to introduce the radical changes we need.
				<br  /><br  />
				I have no doubt that there are many who will disagree. Many who think that tradition and conservative politics are good and should be continued. That's good: democracy thrives on debate and freedom to express your ideas. But remember which parties have tried to curtail that democracy. Remember which parties have tried to weaken the Direct Democracy Act or disenfranchise arbitrary groups. This cannot be allowed to happen. Politicians ought to be accountable directly to the people and the ballot box is the primary method of this.
				<br  /><br  />
				So when you walk into the polling booth on the 24<sup>th</sup> of August, I hope you consider lending your vote to the Pirate Party. Or else, you may find yourself losing it altogether at the hands of another party.
				<br  /><br  />
				We in the Pirate Party are the only party you can rely on to deliver a freer, fairer future for all.
				<br  /><br  />

			<content>
				<p><strong>One of the most important parts of the British political system is democracy – it’s how we distribute power and how we keep those in charge in check. But in today’s society our democracy does not go nearly far enough. The head of state is in her role by virtue of having an old family, and an unelected body of politically-motivated appointments has a say in what becomes law and what doesn’t. In a country that claims to be home to the Mother of All Parliaments this is simply unacceptable.</strong></p>
				<p>The Pirate Party would therefore be an ardent supporter of a <strong>written constitution</strong> to codify tradition and convention into a set of rules governing how Britain should be ruled. In this way we hope to remove the possibility of edge-cases that allow for power-hungry politicians to become de facto dictators. While we have confidence on current politicians not to abuse their power it is most certainly better for there to be no loophole at all than a loophole that everyone trusts not to be used – the reliance on trusting people to properly perform their job is the problem, not the solution.</p>
				<p>Tied into this, we would be in favour of <strong>abolishing the monarchy</strong> in favour of an elected president and <strong>reforming the House of Lords</strong> to consist of both elected parliamentarians and industry body-chosen experts in fields like medicine, technology and education. This would allow for an upper house that actually advises, rather than being Parliament’s retirement home. Britain deserves an upper chamber that offers guidance to and advises the Commons, rather than acting as an annoying speed bump, throttling legislation’s progress and preventing progress.</p>
				<p>But what good is a Parliament that is only elected every six months? In a democracy the people deserve a right to change their mind more frequently than the current election allows. The solution is to <strong>expand the Direct Democracy Act</strong> by reducing thresholds for referenda to be called, and to <strong>introduce People’s Assemblies</strong> which can form legally-binding results with a sufficiently-high majority, and can force a debate in Parliament otherwise. It is only right that the people are able to have a direct say in their affairs, and by taking a random sample of the British population we can ensure that there is no possibility of bias or partisanship, but instead the unfiltered opinions of the public.</p>
				<p>On the subject of allowing people as much of a say as possible, legislation was moved this term to forbid criminals, even those whose crimes did not relate to elections at all, from voting. This use of disenfranchisement is unacceptable, and the Pirate Party would not only <strong>oppose all disenfranchisement</strong> but would also aim to <strong>expand the vote to non-resident British citizens</strong>, as the actions of the UK Government directly affect the welfare of Brits overseas in the form of foreign negotiations and treaties.</p>
				<p>The Palace of Westminster, while stunningly beautiful, is unfortunately not in the best shape – several parts are in dire need of repair, and even the famous landmark that is Big Ben is soon to stop bonging. The Pirates would support the <strong>temporary relocation of Parliament</strong> to a city decided by referenda to allow for repairs to this historic building to go ahead and to give other cities in the UK an opportunity to shine.</p>

				<p><strong>Britain's place in the world is an influential one. As a G7 member, a major trading partner of many countries and a permanent member of the UN Security Council, when the UK does something the world watches. This makes it doubly important, though, that we set a good example and make our ethics and morals shine upon the world's stage. Britain ought to act as an voice calling for reasoned and peaceful negotiation, and for the upholding of the values of democracy and social liberty that we hold so close to heart A Pirate Britain is a Britain that's a responsible figure around the negotiating table and the war room alike.</strong></p>
				<p>War is an awful thing. It destroys livelihoods, it ruins lives and it kills, and it is justified in the name of liberty. But the families of the dead and wounded don't care about whether the war is fought in the name of fascism or of freedom — the effect is the same. This is why it is so extraordinary that it is easier for the Government to declare war than to make peace, the latter requiring a confirmatory motion from Parliament. Peace ought to be the rule, not the exception, so a Pirate government would commit to <strong>giving Parliament a legally-binding say on any war declaration</strong> before it can be made. This would finally correct the imbalance and make sure that any war was performed in a reasoned and measured way.</p>
				<p>One of Britain's most important international actions is its developmental aid and, despite efforts this term to reduce it, British aid still holds strong at the UN-recommended percentage of GDP. But we can do better. A Pirate cabinet would <strong>increase international aid spending to 1.25% of GDP</strong> . It is our duty to help countries that are less developed by providing them with the resources to build and grow, and developmental aid is our current best way of doing this. Developmental aid goes towards providing clean, safe water supplies. It goes towards investing in hospitals, schools and transport infrastructure. British aid is a crucial source of income for some countries and it is important to ensure as much is available as possible.</p>
				<p>Offensive cyberattacks only serve to provoke and result in retaliations. This is a fact that any cybersecurity expert will tell you, and it applies to GCHQ as well. In the face of threats like Russia and China, we cannot afford escalate tensions further, and instead we should focus on protecting ourselves. This is why a Pirate in the Foreign Office would <strong>instruct GCHQ to avoid offensive action</strong> at all costs, and instead focus on hardening British computer systems, both Government and private-sector alike, and making sure we are as ready and prepared as possible, with backups and redundancies in place for the worst-case scenarios.</p>
				<p>By maintaining a nuclear arsenal, Britain is taking part in an international game of chicken, where the penalty for neither side blinking is the destruction of all humankind as we know it. The Pirates <strong>support the scrapping of Trident</strong>, an over-priced system, and support calling on our international partners around the world to reduce the size of or get rid of entirely their nuclear weapons. Furthermore, we will <strong>formally recognise Israel's nuclear capabilities</strong>. It's an open secret at this point and only by recognising it can we encourage the Israelis to sign the Non-Proliferation Treaty.</p>

				<p>The current international treaties governing space are basic and lack detail, and the UK's only space-related legislation is from 1986. But with the possibility of humans colonising the moon and maybe even other world in a permanent way becoming ever-more real, we have to acknowledge that this simplistic legal framework simply will not work in the future. What we need is to <strong>negotiate an international framework to govern space exploration</strong>, but we need to do so in such a away as to emphasise three things. Firstly, the importance of scientific discovery. Space is first and foremost a place to uncover the mysteries of the universe and solve the largest puzzles facing modern science. Secondly, the necessity to preserve extraterrestrial environments. We absolutely cannot under any circumstances cause a second climate emergency, and with the possibility of life having existed on Mars or Europa it is crucial we keep their natural environments as pristine as possible. Thirdly, the need to protect the rights of future colonists. Astronauts shouldn't be pawns in some geopolitical game and any prospective treaty should ensure their right to self-determination, including the possibility of starting a new country.</p>
				<p>Nothing is more important in the world than peace. War leads to unnecessary death, destruction and injury. As such, the primary defence focus of any government should be, well, defence. Instead of deploying troops overseas, we would <strong>focus on defending Britain, its dependencies and its allies</strong> . Instead of wasting resources on unsolicited military deployments, we should concentrate on making Britain as well-defended as possible to deter hostile attacks on British territory. We believe that the best <em>off</em>ence is a strong <em>de</em>fence, unlike conventional wisdom, and so we will be an ardent fighter against uncalled-for aggression on foreign soil.</p>
				<p>It is our firm belief in the Pirate Party that a global response to the climate emergency is required. For many countries, though, this simply cannot be done while balancing the books, so a Pirate government would create a fund that would <strong>make funding into renewables available to other countries</strong> . When requested by the government of the country, the fund would cover the cost of any renewable energy project, subject to the consent of the Foreign Secretary. We would also work with our international partners, including those in Europe, the US and Australia, to encourage them to and assist them in setting up their own similar funds or contributing towards our one. A Pirate Britain would be one that makes use of Britain's place in the world to tackle the massive global issues that affect us all.</p>
				<p>In the modern world there is no reason why anyone should be turned away at the border. In the case of those forced to our shores by war, famine or political persecution it is our duty to accept them; for those arriving by choice is is our honour. We therefore support a <strong>near open-border policy</strong> , with the sole exceptions of suspected terrorists, people traffickers or members of proscribed groups, for example. Britain is a welcoming and accepting place and the idea that we cannot accommodate more people is an outlandish suggestion. Britain should be one of the greatest countries in the world, and it is far better for refugees and immigrants to find a home here than to die a horrible death in the Channel because we simply did not care.</p>

			<header id="environment-header"><h1>Environment, Food and Energy</h1></header>
			<content>
				<p><strong>The single largest problem facing not only Britain but also the entire world is the climate crisis. It is our duty to do whatever it takes to reverse the disastrous course we currently find ourselves on by investing in green energy and ensuring consumers buy responsibly. However, by far the group with the largest role to play is the wealthy — the rich business owners and financiers who have profited from the destruction of our natural world need to be taught to stop and to invest in instead protecting the environment.</strong></p>
				<p>One of the largest greenwashing schemes, essentially an ecological scam, is the fact that we export our emissions to other countries, like China, then blame them for having high carbon emissions. This often takes the form of either imports or of carbon credits, and so we would <strong>outlaw "carbon crediting" schemes, and introduce a large carbon tax at the border on imports</strong>. This would have the effect of preventing British companies from greenwashing themselves by exporting emissions, ensuring proper accountability and allowing for future measures to be better targeted towards the biggest emitters, rather than allowing them to evade protection by participating in "offsetting" schemes that have little or no accountability and often turn out to not actually have any effect on the environment whatsoever. Added to this, such schemes are more able to be used by richer companies, essentially letting the rich buy their way out of environmental regulation.</p>
				<p>The ongoing cost of living crisis has demonstrated the devastating effects of over-reliance on foreign electricity, gas and oil imports. It's time Britain <strong>invested in proper energy independence</strong> by funding in local, home-grown initiatives to increase domestic energy production, a side-effect of which would be a shift away from imported fossil fuels towards cleaner renewable sources. One example with this would be wind energy; with the consent of the Scottish Parliament we would massively increase funding towards North Sea offshore wind farms, and would invest in unlocking England's natural wind resources as well.</p>
				<p>Current forecasts predict that one of the major issues of the 21st century will be food security. As desertification intensifies, available farmland will decrease and food supplies will shrink rapidly. This is why it is more important than ever to focus on increasing food production by <strong>encouraging the establishment of allotments and the use of urban gardening techniques</strong>. By encouraging the British people to grow their own food, we can reduce demand and decrease the price of the average shopping basket. It would also be healthier, as home-grown food tends to be fresher and more nutritious than shop-bought food.</p>
				<p>There has been much talk recently around airport expansion, with calls for extra runways at Heathrow, Gatwick, Manchester and Birmingham. However, these would be antithetical and anathematic to the goal of alleviating the climate crisis; planes are one of the world's biggest polluters, and so a responsible government would be decreasing demand for air travel, not driving it up by investing in airports. We would therefore <strong>avoid airport expansions where possible</strong> to allow for a shift towards greener forms of transport.</p>

				<p>As we tackle the climate crisis we will all have to make sacrifices. However, the rich and wealthy who have parasitically extracted value from the environment for their own personal leisure will have to pay more. Planes are big polluters and should only be used where necessary, so we would <strong>ban the use of private helicopters and jets</strong> to avoid the unnecessary pollution they cause. Tied into this, although less important due the UK's situation, would be banning spaceflight for purely recreational purposes, as rocket fuel is one of the most polluting fuels due to the vast quantities required.</p>
				<p>Although the very utterance of its name is a political poisoned chalice, it is an undeniable fact that nuclear energy provides a very effective baseline power load while still being one of the most environmentally friendly and safe types of energy available, and so a Pirate government would <strong>invest in nuclear fission, as well as nuclear fusion research</strong>. However, as nuclear energy is likely to be a longer-term strategy than other forms of green energy, we would <strong>invest more in non-nuclear renewables</strong> than nuclear to be able to achieve net-zero carbon emissions much sooner than would otherwise be possible. Together we hope this spending will be able to chart a course away from the collapse of civilisation.</p>
				<p>A large part of domestic energy and fuel usage goes towards heating, and much of this is lost due to inefficient thermal design. The way to alleviate these is to <strong>set up a fund dedicated to paying for heat pump installation, window glazing and insulation</strong>, as this will enable Britons who otherwise would be deterred by price to invest in making their house more environmentally friendly at no charge to them. This would also link in to our strategy to tackle the cost of living crisis, as heat pumps tend to be cheaper to run than other forms of heating and insulation would permit people to pay less on heating, driving down prices for energy and fuel.</p>
				<p>As food security is likely to become one of the future's largest causes of conflict, it is crucial now more than ever to support our farmers and food producers across the country however we can. Through <strong>detailed and comprehensive investment</strong> into the agriculture sector and through educating the next generation of farmers we can ensure a future for British farming, and by encouraging a shift from pastoral farming towards arable farming we can achieve a higher crop density, as plant-based food requires less land and water per kilogram than animal-based food, which would further increase agricultural production. In addition, we oppose the horrifying land value tax hike facing farmers due to the Central Line budget, resulting in taxes of three times farmers' incomes.</p>

			<content>
				<p><strong>Schools, colleges and universities are the tools with which we prepare children and young people for the future. Unfortunately we do not have a magic crystal ball and so any curriculum is inherently going to be flawed, but the job of government is to choose topics that are most likely to successfully equip students with the necessary tools for their adult lives. It is our sincere belief that we can compose an up-to-date national curriculum that is suited for the modern world of the 21st century, with a focus on personalised teaching and on teaching students not what to think but how to think. We would also recognise that learning is a lifelong process, and that adulthood is a better time to learn than never.</strong></p>
				<p>One of the things that educators have been saying for years, and which has unfortunately fallen on deaf ears, is that teachers know students best. But is can be difficult when managing a class of 30, 40 or even 50 students to develop a personal connection with each one, and this is one of the main advantages of private schooling — small class sizes. To remedy the bloated class sizes in state schools we would propose a <strong>massive hike to teachers' salaries</strong> to attract more to go into the field. This, combined with the building of new schools across the country, would enable teachers to give more personalised teaching to students, letting them play to their strengths and weaknesses.</p>
				<p>It is a shocking indictment of today's world that, despite paying for education for every person between the ages of four and nineteen, we cannot bring ourselves to pay for university tuition. A degree is a passport to the future and we should be encouraging as many people as possible to get the best education they can. University can already be very expensive between accommodation and the general costs of moving out, so we should avoid adding addition costs by <strong>covering tuition fees for every UK resident</strong> and opening degrees up for as many as possible.</p>
				<p>In the modern world, where fake news abounds and ludicrous claims are taken as fact, it is key that young people are taught <strong>basic logic and critical thinking as part of the curriculum</strong>, allowing them to assess the plausibility of claims they see online and can find fallacies and flaws in arguments made by politicians and conspiracy theorists alike. It is also important that digital literacy is taught at a younger age that it currently is, as an incredible proportion of adults are unable to use a computer for basic purposes, and learning these vital skills at an early age and reinforcing them throughout childhood and adolescence is the key to lowering those numbers.</p>
				<p>It takes great bravery to acknowledge that your education failed you as an adult, or admit that you picked the wrong courses for you when given the choice. It shouldn't be made any harder by having to worry about the cost of becoming a student as an adult, so we would <strong>establish a fund to pay for adult education</strong> for the very poorest who cannot afford it. Everyone should be able to learn what they want to, and the price of taking several years off work to take the time to learn the area you are truly passionate about is already great enough. Why put more on the plates of single parents who need a degree? Why make those who need to retake an A level to get a job suffer any more than they already have to? The answer is that there is no reason to do so aside from the greed of educational establishments.</p>

			<content>
				<p><strong>The good health of the general public is key to any country's success and Britain has made progress in this area in strides, with the world's greatest National Health Service. But we can do better. The NHS is still fraught with cost-to-benefit decisions that in an ideal world would not exist, and government funding has historically been lacking leading to spiralling backlogs and problems with access to GP appointments. Healthcare is also denied to certain groups without jumping through excessive hurdles with a supposedly moral justification that is not backed by the science, leading to excess suicides that needn't happen and rates of depression that are far higher that the general population.</strong></p>
				<p>One key tenet of Pirate health policy is that all healthcare should be available free to the patient, no ifs, no buts, and no hidden costs. Unfortunately a big stumbling block for this is prescriptions; pharmaceutical companies' greed drives them to charge exorbitant prices for medical essentials. The solution to this is a <strong>nationalised pharmaceuticals company</strong> to develop and manufacture the cures of tomorrow's diseases. There are those who would call this too ambitious or expensive, to which we respond by pointing out the massive saving the NHS could make by buying from a company without artificially hiked-up prices, and also the potential for exports that such a company would entail. The UK could very easily foster a strong drugs industry supplying cheap medicine to the people in the world who need it most, potentially saving millions or even billions from treatable illness.</p>
				<p>Under the Gender Recognition Act, in order to obtain a Gender Recognition Certificate trans people have to: obtain consent from their spouse; be undergoing or have undergone transition; have lived as their proper gender for at least two years; pay a fee of £140; and, most shockingly, convince a panel of adjudicators that you really <em>mean</em> it. The Pirates would support <strong>self-ID for trans people</strong>, meaning that by simply filling out and submitting a form, a trans person can become legally recognised as their proper gender. We would also introduce an <strong>informed consent model of trans healthcare</strong>, similar to that seen in several states in the US, in which a trans person can go to a GP who, if convinced that the person understands any potential risks of healthcare, can prescribe hormone blockers and HRT, if desired. We would also cover all gender-confirming surgery on the NHS.</p>
				<p>It is shocking how many children do not know basic first aid like CPR or the recovery position. Every child should be able to use a defibrillator and should know how to do abdominal thrusts. Every student should know how to find and take both their own and someone else's pulse and how to communicate to 999 the extent of an emergency or incident. We would therefore support <strong>mandatory first aid lessons as part of the national curriculum</strong>. As more and more children deal with depression and suicidal ideation, it would also be suitable for these to include advice on dealing with mental health in both students and their classmates.</p>
				<p>Oft invoked as a political football but never implemented, the Pirates would support the introduction of a free <strong>National Dental Service</strong> to ensure that every person in the UK can ensure proper dental health — and we would follow through on our promises in a Pirate DHSC!</p>

				<p><strong>Britain has a strong, proud history of creative endeavours — who around the world hasn't heard of Shakespeare, the Beatles or William Blake? And yet, if we do nothing, this culture is at risk of being erased by the overpowering Americanism of Disney and Hollywood. But with proper government assistance, we can re-energise the British creative industry and share our iconic literature and art once more. Meanwhile, the Internet, streaming and smartphones are changing the way we interact with media and how we communicate with the world around us. We would regulate the digital world to ensure it remains useful and enjoyable for everyone.</strong></p>
				<p>Since 1998 the UK has not seen any data protection laws and the Data Protection Act 1998 is vastly outdated, from a time before widespread Internet surveillance amd when most data storage was in a single mainframe or was on an old-fashioned pen-and-paper system. We would <strong>bring privacy legislation into the 21st century</strong>, with a new Data Protection Act and harsher sanctions for those breaking privacy rules. The era of an unregulated Internet that steals its users' personal and private information for their own profit will be over, replaced by an Internet that's safe and fair for everyone.</p>
				<p>It can be hard for the poorest in society to find the money for leisure, so we think it's only right to help them do so by <strong>creating a national film studio</strong> to produce films that are free in cost and free in use. These will be available to cinemas and movie theatres at no charge to be shown, streaming platforms will be able to stream them at no cost and viewers will be able to download them for watching in their own home with no strings attached.</p>
				<p>Long copyright is a godsend to multinational corporations. It allows them to sell old works just as well as if they were new, while ensuring a monopoly on their creative works. This is why the Pirates would push for a <strong>reduction or even abolition of copyright terms</strong>. However, it is important that this does not end up damaging artists, writers and musicians, so we would provide government compensation for creative works to ensure that creatives do not lose their income stream as a result of this change to copyright.</p>
				<p>For a government system, the most crucial attribute to have is transparency and reliability. People need to be able to see how it works, and they need to be confident that it will continue to work. Proprietary software does not meet either of these criteria — it is opaque by design, and it is prone to tampering from the developers at any moment. As such, we would <strong>switch all government and civil service computer systems to open-source software</strong>, including the GNU/Linux operating system, and, where possible, migrate to open hardware to ensure that all bases are covered.</p>
				<p>In the modern world more and more of our progress relies on scientific innovation and the sharing of data and information around the world. This is why it is so worrying to see so much research stuck behind paywalls and journal subscriptions. A Pirate government would ensure that <strong>all research done on government grants and money will be open-access</strong>, meaning anyone can read it free of charge. This allows other researchers to build on the work of their predecessors, but it also allows non-scientists to read papers and make more reasoned judgements.</p>

			<content>
				<p><strong>One of the primary duties of government — nay, its entire raison d'être — is to support the worse-off in society by providing their necessities. However, between cuts and privatisations under the government of the late 20th century, and a general lack of impetus, the current government does not unfortunately do this for most of the things people need to survive. By improving working conditions and engaging in an ambitious program of nationalisations we hope to improve the quality of life for millions across the country.</strong></p>
				<p>One of the key things we can do to improve the quality of life across the UK is improve access to crucial services, so we would provide <strong>nationalised water and clothing</strong> for the people of Britain to ensure that no one goes without the necessities in life. We would also support <strong>giving every citizen a bank account with a national bank</strong> to end the era of banks playing fast and loose with savers' money. Under our scheme, every Briton would have an opt-out account automatically created for them at birth. These national services will ensure that everyone has access to crucial aspects of modern life and to the things we all need in life.</p>
				<p>Many people across the UK simply do not have the time for leisure and a proper work-life balance. They are rushed off their feet working and as a result rates of chronic stress and burnout are rising dramatically. We would support a <strong>four day working week</strong> to ensure that everyone has time to relax and enjoy themselves. The link between work and stress is well-established — people working more than 40 hours a week are six times as likely to become burnt out — we just need to act on it.</p>
				<p>When the Pub Nationalisation and Community Co-operatisation Act created KONSUM, the intention was always to later include food supplies and establish a national supermarket chain. We would follow through on this by <strong>using KONSUM to create a nationalised supermarket</strong> and manage food distribution. The goal here is to provide a way to lower food prices without harming farmers by allowing the government to reduce them at the supermarket. Driving down food prices is an important way to help alleviate the cost of living crisis and put Britain back on track.</p>
				<p>We in the Pirates are firm in our belief that the way to ensure people are not forced into work they do not want to do is a universal income. A universal income ensures that every person can afford the food, water and rent they need to pay, so we would commit to continuing universal income. We would also provide a <strong>large grant upon birth to all individuals</strong>, the goal of which would be, along with removing tuition fees, to provide everyone with the best start in life possible. We strongly believe that the state should provide everyone with the ability to do what they wish without worrying about money.</p>
				<p>When people in the workplace start to organise, they inevitably end up with more power to manage their own affairs and more control over their work. We believe this is important in a workplace and so we would <strong>encourage unionisation and co-operativisation and make this easier to achieve</strong>. Workplace autonomy is an admirable goal and we invite all workers of Britain to join the fight for a louder voice at the bargaining table and a more fair pay distribution, so it would be our duty to stand in solidarity with workers seeking better organisation.</p>

			<header id="housing-header"><h1>Housing, Communities & Local Government</h1></header>
			<content>
				<p><strong>A key Pirate tenet is that of localism. Decisions ought to be made as close to those they affect as possible — local people are simply more knowledgeable on their affairs and are more likely to be incentivised to do a good job. It is therefore the duty of any government to ensure that local government and communities are given the powers they need to develop community-led initiatives and schemes. Councils should be more independent from central government and able to control their own business more effectively. Regionalism is an admirable goal and we support it in all its forms.</strong></p>
				<p><strong>Simultaneously, Britain is undergoing a housing crisis. Young people leaving home for the first time are unable to find affordable housing to buy or to rent, while landlords hold several properties, often empty. It is shameful that houses go empty while young people go homeless. This is unacceptable and, as well as existing home-building strategies, we should be certain to prevent this misuse of property by allowing it to go unused during a homelessness crisis. It is simply inhumane and unethical to allow such predatory practices to continue.</strong></p>
				<p>As part of our drive towards ensuring people are involved in the decisions that affect them most (something that our planned Direct Democracy Act reforms are key to), we would <strong>give local councils much more independence from central government</strong>, providing them with additional powers and strength. In particular, one course of action we would be open to is devolving certain forms of taxation to councils and allowing those councils to carry out what would have otherwise been local government schemes with that money. Allowing councils access to tax in an important first step to a more regionalist approach to government.</p>
				<p>To end the scourge of second-home ownership, we would support <strong>banning owning multiple properties</strong> similarly to in France. When people own multiple homes, they are necessarily depriving others of a place to live, and therefore contributing to homelessness. In a modern world it is unthinkable that we accept this as our fate instead of taking direct action against greedy landlords.</p>
				<p>However, we recognise that this is very much a long-term goal. As such, we would initially support <strong>banning uninhabited homes</strong>, except where an effort is being made to find a renter while offering reasonable prices. This allows for landlords to have time to find buyers for their property before we introduce an outright ban on second homes, while providing a way to ensure these houses to not go unused in the meantime. We hope this will result in a shift towards more being able to own their own home or find affordable rent.</p>
				<p>If we are serious about finding solutions to the climate emergency, it is of utmost importance that we put our money where our mouths are. One of the biggest sources of domestic carbon emissions stems from heating, and in many cases this is because houses simply aren't sufficiently insulated. We would <strong>establish a fund to cover the costs of insulation and extra glazing</strong> on UK homes, both on existing houses and on those newly-built. In addition to helping reduce carbon emissions, this would also cut down on energy costs, something important at this crucial juncture.</p>

			<content>
				<p><strong>One of the oldest recorded set of laws dates back to around the fifth millennium BCE, under the Babylonians. Their punishments for crimes were largely based on retribution - a slave talking back at their master could have their tongue cut out, for example. Indeed, many justice systems around the world, including the British, have been shaped by this sense of punishment. However, we believe that, as a nation, the focus of our law should be less about punishing the guilty and more about preventing future harm and rehabilitation.</strong></p>
				<p>Our long-term goal for justice reform in the UK would be <strong>prison abolition</strong>. The entire prison system is rotten to its core; from the day-to-day work of prison officers on the ground to the managers and directors at the top, everyone is complicit in an egregious scheme to remove liberties, often on the whim of how a judge happens to be feeling on a particular day, in a way that has been historically racist in its operation. A Pirate government would play no further role in this.</p>
				<p>However, as the complete end to the prison system is very much a hopeful ambition for a single term, we would strongly push for a <strong>wide-reaching review into prison conditions</strong>, with a view to finding ways to improve the living conditions of inmates as much as possible. We have already seen steps towards this recently by allowing reading materials and ensuring a proper balanced diet, but it is now time to launch a full-scale investigation.</p>
				<p>One facet of this study into prison living conditions would be looking into the possibility of <strong>the expansion of open prisons and working prisons</strong>. These are schemes in which inmates are given more freedom and liberties by allowing them to earn a wage while in prison. Typified by recent reforms at Strangeways, these sorts of reforms give inmates an opportunity to learn useful skills that will help them find employment post-release, they also provide prisoners with some money with which they can make a start in life.</p>
				<p>The primary purpose of the justice system should be rehabilitation and prevention. We should aim to form a society that is not retributive but aims to help people change after committing an offence. We would therefore emphasise our <strong>focus on rehabilitation over punishment</strong>. A Piratical justice system would highlight the need to shift away from legal blame-games towards reducing the overall harm to society caused by potential reoffenders.</p>
				<p>Whole-life orders, in which a judge decides that a criminal will never be allowed parole under any circumstances, are a sorry feature of our Justice system. Every criminal, no matter how bad the offence, should at the very least have the possibility of getting out on good behaviour - otherwise, we cannot truly say that our justice system is rehabilitative. Life sentences, where a prisoner will serve indefinitely, already exist, so we would <strong>end the use of whole-life orders</strong> by judges.</p>
				<p>The use of artificial intelligence and algorithms in policing and justice is one of the great controversies of our time, and several Justice Secretaries have promised to no avail to outlaw their use. We would finally <strong>ban the use of AI and computerised predictive algorithms in sentencing and in policing</strong>, as these systems often have racist, sexist and bigoted views hard-coded in.</p>

				<p><strong>We live in an increasingly interconnected world. This is simply a fact of modern life, and any government that fails to recognise this does so at its peril. We see this connectedness in the digital world. We see it in the economic world. But most of all, we see it in the world of transport. With an expanding network of rail, both high-speed and standard, Britons are becoming more and more able to easily meet and commute, resulting in movement around the country at an unprecedented rate. But unfortunately, investment where it's really needed has sometimes been lacking, sidelined in favour of what happens to be the current Secretary's pet project. We would put money where it's actually important to.</strong></p>
				<p>It is our firm belief in the Pirate Party that one crucial way to help reduce Britain's carbon emissions is to switch from personal transport like cars towards public transport like buses, trams and metro systems. However, a key roadblock preventing people from using public transport is cost, which is why we would <strong>make public transport within cities and towns free</strong>. This would include most forms of transport used to commute, with the notable exceptipn of the majority of conventional heavy rail. We believe this will encourage the average person to choose public transport over a polluting car, reducing congestion and bringing us that step closer to carbon neutrality.</p>
				<p>Unfortunately, in many big cities transport times from one end to the other can be outrageously long. We would support <strong>investment in trams and metro-style heavy rail</strong> in major British cities. It would remain to be seen and would depend on the existing city layout whether this would take the form of an underground system similar to London's tubes, an overground system similar to existing rail across the country, or a raised system like Chicago's L, but we would find the most appropriate way forward in each place on a case by case basis. Metro systems have proved to be highly efficient at transporting passengers around cities, and are a key way to make British transportation greener.</p>
				<p>Dedicated to high-speed rail in the country, we would <strong>continue work on HS2 and HS3</strong>, while also proposing several high-speed rail links. These would include links directly from London to Cornwall, links from London to Cardiff and Edinburgh, with the consent of the Senedd and Parliament respectively, and high speed rail to supplement existing backbone heavy rail systems like the East Coast and West Coast mainlines, the Transpennine Express and similar routes. We would additionally look into the possibility of a Channel Tunnel-style route from Edinburgh to Belfast, again with the consent of the Assembly.</p>
				<p>As well as encouraging a shift from personal to public transport, we would also endeavour to make cars less polluting. One of the main ways we can do this is by incentivising the use of electric vehicles, and by creating a scheme named "<strong>A Charging Port In Every Home</strong>", we would provide funding to allow Britons to easily and cheaply invest in a charging port for their home. This allows millions to get an electric car without fear of running out of battery kilometres from the nearest charger, and also allows for increased grid balancing capacity by permitting the use of car batteries to balance supply and demand.</p>

				<p><strong>One of the most ever-present issues in British politics is that of the union. In Wales, centuries of oppression and cultural genocide has led to an unhappy populace who, if the Plaid Cymru First Minister is anything to judge by. In Northern Ireland, the Unionist community has absolutely collapsed, with Irish reunification or even Northern Irish independence on the cards. In Scotland, the SNP's meteoric rise means that their independence, too, is looking ever more likely. Meanwhile, Westminster has attempted to cling on to power in the other nations of the United Kingdom, looking more and more disunited by the second. The Pirates would negotiate with the governments of each nation to come to a fairer devolution settlement for all, and discuss the possibility of independence should there be popular support.</strong></p>
				<p>Our core belief is that in self-determination. Everyone should be able to choose their own future, and tha includes the people of the UK's various devolved nations. As such, we would <strong>approve independence referenda or a border poll</strong>, where called for by the respective devolved governments. In these referenda party members would be free to take their own stances, however, as we think it's important that both sides of the argument are properly weighed up so that the people may come to a reasoned and rational judgement. A Piratical government would believe in presenting the people with the facts and allowing them to arrive at their own conclusions, rather than dictating what we believe to be correct and encouraging blind faith.</p>
				<p>It's clear that many regions of the UK want similar powers to those held by Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland. hold. We would therefore be in favour of holding <strong>referenda on devolution to Cornwall and Yorkshire</strong>, and additionally to any other area that requests it. We are proudly in favour if a Senedh Kernow and a Yorkshire Assembly as we feel that all parts of the UK should be able to have the greatest say in their affairs possible, and so in these referenda we would campaign for greater autonomy and freedom in these areas of England that are nations in their own right, and should be recognised as such.</p>
				<p>One of the biggest matters of debate in Northern Ireland's political sphere is various proposals for a Bill of Rights. Mandated by the Good Friday Agreement but never carried out until today, such a Bill would seek to protect the liberties, rights and freedoms of each community, as well as helping to ease cross-community tensions. We would work with the Executive to <strong>finally deliver a Northern Irish Bill of Rights</strong>, as the days of dither and delay should most certainly be over. It's to deliver for the people of Northern Ireland, and end the chaos. It's time we got Northern Ireland back on track</p>
				<p>One of the key responsibilities of the Westminster government is to consider devolution requests that are put before it. Several have been seen recently, including Scottish welfare devolution, Northern Irish income tax devolution and the Holyrood PfG's borrowing devolution. A Pirate government would <strong>carefully consider devolution requests and likely agree to them</strong>, as we are believers in giving as much power to the devolved legislatures as possible. To this end we would deliver these devolution requests for the people of Northern Ireland, Scotland and Wales.</p>
