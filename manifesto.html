				<strong>To the people of the Britain and Northern Ireland,</strong>
				<br  /><br  />
				Almost seven months ago, you put your faith in me and my party to deliver on our manifesto. We promised radical constitutional reforms unprecedented in the modern political scene, and while we certainly still have a long way to go, the Pirate crew have been working tirelessly to help build a freer, fairer future as promised. Between the introduced Direct Democracy Enhancement Act which would finally have given the people of Britain a fair say in their affairs, the Space Industry Act marking a turning point for the UK space sector and the variety of behind-the-scenes work we've been doing in cabinet to strengthen the nation, the Pirates have had your back.
				<br  /><br  />
				That's why this election you can count on us to deliver. Within this manifesto we have a new set of goals, added to those we've yet to do, broadly split into our Five Pillars for a Brighter Future: save the planet, fight for the workers, distribute power, protect lives and, most importantly, build a better Britain. By accomplishing these we aim to set the UK on a path towards prosperity.
				<br  /><br  />
				It's clear that other parties can't be trusted: the Liberal Democrats and Labour have split apart, forming splinter group Unity. The Conservative leader mysteriously disappeared mid-term, leaving them in disarray. Solidarity lack a unified vision, while the Social Liberals' Commons turnout speaks volumes about how much they can be trusted to achieve in office. The variety of minor parties that have sprung up this term, including the Loonies, the Greens and the Social Democrats, have all remained either quiet to the point of irrelevance or loud to the point of idiocy. Only the Pirates can really be trusted.
				<br  /><br  />
				On the 6th April, a crossroads sits before you. One path leads to chaos and confusion, a government in the hands of businessmen and money. The other leads to a responsible government acting in the interests of people and communities - and that's the brighter future Britain deserves.
				<br  /><br  />

				<h2>Protecting the environment</h2>
				<h1>SAVE THE PLANET</h1>
			</header>
			<content>
				<p><strong>When it comes to saving the planet, the first thing that enters your mind is protecting the environment. Between rising levels of CO2 and other greenhouse gases, a biodiversity loss issue growing ever more serious and pollution of all types at an unprecedented level, it's clear there's a need for swift and strong action.</strong></p>
				<p>So where do we begin? One of the biggest successes in the UK so far has been a carbon tax - but this is not applied to imported products. As a result, imports become a loophole against this tax, encouraging exploitative practices and worsening our trade deficit to boot. Our flagship climate policy is to extend this to imported products - British laws should apply to products used in Britain, and there's no reason why tax-dodging multinationals should be allowed to bypass our environmental protections whenever they see fit.</p>
				<p>Furthermore, avoidance of climate regulations is assisted by use of "carbon credits" - allegedly intended to offset emissions, the majority of such schemes consist of protecting forests that weren't going to be cut down or crossing off numbers on a spreadsheet without doing any actual action. As a result, crediting is another tool to avoid paying carbon taxes and to bypass local regulations by outsourcing climate impacts. Again, a Pirate government would outlaw this shameful practice, ensuring that accounting for emissions can be done properly and fairly.</p>
				<p>But what use is restricting corporations if the government still relies on fossil fuel-based electricity generation? Britain sadly still uses coal- and gas-fired power stations, hindering efforts both to meet carbon emissions targets and to attain energy independence. The Pirates propose a package of investment into renewable sources such as tidal, hydroelectric and wind, including international development funding in the same, recognising climate change to be a global problem. Furthermore, recent advances in nuclear fusion present an exciting opportunity for energy generation - through investment in this technology we can move closer to harnessing its limitless possibilities.</p>
				<p>However, there is also a lot individuals can do. Crucially, urban environments have a long way to go to make sure pollinators and wildlife can flourish - and by encouraging and improving access to spaces for urban gardening, biodiversity in cities can flourish - and there's also added benefits such as the ability to grow cheaper and more nutritious food, as well as the mood boost associated with even just the sight of greenery. Furthermore, electric cars (when manufactured sustainably) have considerable benefits, especially compared to air pollution from petrol or diesel vehicles, and to encourage their uptake we would fund the purchase of EV charging ports, with the goal that everyone who wants one, can have one.</p>
				<p>Lastly, it's important to curb the excesses of the richest that have put us in this mess. One of the biggest-polluting sectors is aviation, and of that the most unnecessary part is private jets. Inspired by greed, private jets and helicopters result in massive increases to emissions without much tangible benefit over other aeroplanes. The Pirates would support a ban on these wasteful craft to help our ailing planet.</p>

				<h2>Uniting the world</h2>
				<h1>SAVE THE PLANET</h1>
			</header>
			<content>
				<p><strong>In order to save the planet, significant international cooperation is needed - the crises of disease, poverty and climate change are all global issues and no single country can solve them all. This is why it's so important to unite with other countries and work together on worldwide problems.</strong></p>
				<p>To this end, one of the best things we can do to help improve international collaboration is to increase our international development funding. The Pirate Party would commit to a baseline level of 1.25% of GDP, and would conduct a review into all spending to ensure that this money is being used in the most effective manner. For too long spending has been increased without a coherent plan, meaning it could be better utilised. In addition, we would invest in overseas renewable energy, helping to reduce emissions of carbon dioxide and equivalent gases. Finally, we would create a scheme dedicated towards providing reparations where the impacts of British involvement are still felt.</p>
				<p>Furthermore, bringing down the artificial borders between countries is a key step in bringing the world together. A Pirate government would impose a near-open border policy, moving to a system that, rather than only excepting a limited selection of people, does the opposite and only excludes those who are wanted for major criminal activities. Additionally, we would work with our counterparts around the globe, including in the European Union, to work towards similar measures in other countries to provide seamless travel between nations. Space also presents an avenue for this goal of cross-border cooperation - with the prospect of more and more living and working in space, barriers between countries become blurred, and we would push for a new Outer Space Treaty to clarify any edge cases and regulate the global space industry.</p>
				<p>The discussion of rockets inevitably leads to the discussion of missiles, and one of the largest points of international tension is nuclear weapons. On this front, the Pirate Party would do two main things: firstly, we would formally recognise the Israeli nuclear arsenal. This has remained an open secret for years and it is our belief that if this fa√ßade of ignorance is broken, Israel's government can more easily be persuaded to sign and ratify the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, helping to make the world a safer place. Secondly, and somewhat more controversially, we would scrap the expensive and unnecessary Trident nuclear deterrent. Unfit for purpose and causing major environmental issues, the system has ballooned in cost and does not even function properly, with overly lax security protocols and constant maintenance leading to not fulfilling the requirement of two submarines on service at all times. A drain on the public purse, we would finally end this.</p>
				<p>Lastly, we would provide Parliament with a final say on any declaration of war. It is unthinkable in the modern age that war, the most consequential thing a country can do, is left to a single person. The fact that the Prime Minister can simply announce a war and it happens means there is no legislative oversight - and the executive is free to misuse that power however they want. We would reintroduce the War Powers Bill to make sure there are much-needed vital democratic safeguards on such an influential decision, and to ensure no misuse of power.</p>

				<h2>Working on the side of labour</h2>
				<h1>FIGHT FOR WORKERS</h1>
			</header>
			<content>
				<p><strong>One of the biggest struggles in modern society is the class struggle between the working class and the bourgeoisie who become rich solely due to already being rich. For too long, workers have been stomped all over by those with power and wealth - and now it's time for a government who will fight with the workers instead of against them.</strong></p>
				<p>This is why workplace democracy and self-organisation are so important. When the workers of a company have a say over the running of that company it improves happiness and productivity, resulting in a stronger economy and a more content populace. This is why the Pirate Party support measures to make unionisation easier, removing barriers and giving employees and workers a strong voice at the negotiating table. In addition, we would make it easier for unions to operate by ensuring that secondary action remains legal and that union dues are tax-deductible, again encouraging people to sign up for their union.</p>
				<p>However, an even better example of workplace democracy is cooperatives. In these, workers directly own the company and self-organise. We would encourage workers to form cooperatives, instituting schemes similar to the community cooperativisation of pubs, whereby the government funds a proportion of the costs to take the company over. We would also reintroduce the Companies Act; inspired by the Rehn-Meidner model, the radical bill would have given 20% of companies' shares to their workers, encouraging reinvestment into the economy and making the path to forming cooperatives easier while also giving a minor economic boost.</p>
				<p>But until then, we need to ensure that employers are giving employees the fairest deal possible. It is our view that a four-day working week (or, equivalently, 32-hours) is a far superior model to the current five-day working week, having been shown to increase the amount workers can get done what also leaving them more satisfied. As a result, we would reduce the number of working hours with this goal. We also believe that companies should be made to pay the transport costs they expect employees to shoulder, as it is unreasonable that geography should be a barrier to gainful employment.</p>
				<p>It is also our opinion that the UK is in desperate need of new privacy legislation. Current law is woefully inadequate in the modern age and often goes unenforced even where there are blatant breaches. The Data Protection Act is designed to protect corporate interests rather than everyday people, and as anyone who's tried to fill out a cookie popup knows, it's never as easy as the legally-proscribed single click solution for avoiding tracking. The Pirate Party is in favour of a new privacy Act, as well as increasing funding for the Information Commissioner so it can properly enforce the law and prosecute against cases where it has been blatantly breached.</p>
				<p>Finally, we believe that every person in Britain should be given the best start in life, regardless of inheritance or their parents' wealth or social status. It is our belief that every person in Britain should be provided with a grant, to be used for things like education or for periods of temporary unemployment or unpaid internship. This ensures that training and similar positions don't fall solely to the rich and that everyone has equal access to the tools they need to improve their lot in life.</p>

				<h2>Reforming justice</h2>
				<h1>FIGHT FOR WORKERS</h1>
			</header>
			<content>
				<p><strong>The weapon of choice of those who seek to oppress the working class is the justice system. Between draconian punishments, poor conditions in supposedly-rehabilitative institutions and systemic biases, policing and the courts are in dire need of reform.</strong></p>
				<p>Let us be clear: our eventual goal is prison abolition. Prisons themselves are tools of capitalism, taking away freedoms arbitrarily. But as there is unfortunately not yet sufficient political will for this, we would instead suffice for now with a review of conditions in prisons, given how overcrowding and generally awful standards and enforcement have historically led to spread of disease and, counter-productively, further crime. Depending on the outcomes of this review, this may well include the construction of more working prisons, where inmates are given the opportunity to gain work experience while in prison (with the crucial aspect of choice) such as by cooking, and open prisons, in which inmates are given fewer or no restrictions.</p>
				<p>In addition, it is worth revisiting whether many of these prisoners even belong there. We would set up a pardons board, reviewing cases both current and historical and making use of the recently-passed Pardons Act to correct wrongs in the justice system. We furthermore would end the use of whole-life orders, a sentencing tool where the convict is put in prison for the entirety of the rest of their lives, distinct from life sentences where they are eligible for parole after a period, usually about 15 years. We would finally ban the use of AI to make decisions about policing and to judge sentencing. AI systems have been shown to be horrifically biased, encoding the racist, sexist and bigoted beliefs of their creators. This has no place in today's justice system, and as part of a larger move towards regulation of AI the Pirate Party would eliminate the usage of these biased and untrustworthy computer systems.</p>
				<p>There is also a need for the justice system to become more compassionate and empathetic. The prison system is unfortunately still not designed to be rehabilitative, for example, and as a result is unsuitable for the purposes it is kept for, serving only as a means of cruel punishment rather than actually reducing crime. Additionally, the police and justice systems are still regressive in the ways they deal with traumatic crime, proper caution not being taken to ensure that victims who have experienced trauma are kept comfortable throughout the questioning process. The Pirate Party would introduce trauma-informed practice guidelines for those in justice and police, and make it so that only trauma-qualified police officers can perform interviews in such traumatic cases.</p>
				<p>Justice also underperforms for young people, despite the focus in recent years in police forces towards county lines groups exploiting children. Youth Justice Teams remain chronically underfunded and are still not uniformly in place, with some councils having them and others not. A useful tool in preventing and dealing with youth crime in a responsible way, the Pirate Party would increase funding and create an obligation for local authorities to put these in place for those who need them. Youth justice in general is due for a review, being unsuited for handling, well, youth justice, and a Pirate Government would write a white paper summarising the best avenues for change to best benefit young people across Britain.</p>

				<h2>Democratising our institutions</h2>
				<h1>DISTRIBUTE POWER</h1>
			</header>
			<content>
				<p><strong>The central Pirate belief is that of self-government: every person should have the greatest possible say in their own lives, through every avenue. Be it in the workplace, in the justice system or in politics, that remains the central tenet. We therefore propose a detailed set of reforms to bring about a truly representative democracy.</strong></p>
				<p>The first roadblock to a democracy is, of course, those parts of our political system that are not elected, most prominently the monarchy. A historically corrupt and institutionally bigoted organisation, the fact that the Royal Family has been allowed for so long to hold absolute power is simply uncountenanceable. To quote the philosopher and revolutionary Thomas Paine, "Kings succeed each other, not as rationals, but as animals" - never has this been more obvious than in the wake of a series of scandals from paedophilia to racism. We call for its immediate abolition. We furthermore believe that the House of Lords should be abolished and replaced with a second elected house, though we are open to including a number of purely advisory experts from industrial, cultural and scientific backgrounds.</p>
				<p>Furthermore, the debacle regarding the Secularisation Act shows that Britain's constitutional arrangements are stuck in the past and simply inadequate for a modern legislative system. It is unclear which body, which parliament, has the authority to even modify these arrangements, and it is possible for Parliament to change them in England but perhaps not in Scotland, causing constitutional mayhem. The Pirate Party would call a constitutional convention to draft a written constitution, a key first step in clarifying these ambiguities, and in particular to focus on the issues with the Acts of Union recently brought to light.</p>
				<p>It is also evident that the most impactful powers should not be held solely by powerful individuals. Power corrupts, and absolute power corrupts absolutely - this is why the crucial decisions should only be entrusted to the people or their representatives. In the United Kingdom today, the power to declare war is vested solely in the Prime Minister (or, more technically, the monarch) and it is our firm belief that Parliament should always have the final say. To this end, we would reintroduce the War Powers Bill.</p>
				<p>One issue of democratic rights that has come sharply into focus last term is that of whistleblowing. EruditeFellow acted in the public interest by disclosing details of words from comped - and yet many whistleblowers acting out of that same public interest are unable to do so due to inadequate protections. We would form a Whistleblower Protection Board to ensure that those brave souls speaking out against what is wrong are able to do so without fear of violence or retribution. This is a fundamental right in a free and fair society and it is one that must be protected at all costs.<p>
				<p>The final issue that faces the UK is that of the Northern Irish Bill of Rights. Mandated by the Good Friday Agreement to protect the rights of both communities, such a bill has not yet been completed despite significant work. A Pirate government would continue the good progress that has been made.</p>

				<h2>Giving power to the masses</h2>
				<h1>DISTRIBUTE POWER</h1>
			</header>
			<content>
				<p><strong>But more crucial even than ensuring a strong representative democracy is to ensure strong direct democracy. Society functions best when those most impacted by decisions have the ability to take matters into their own hands and carve their own future and this is vital for ensuring the success of the UK.</strong></p>
				<p>First and foremost this involves the right to call a referendum. Our revolutionary Direct Democracy Enhancement Bill would have made great strides in this direction, but unfortunately the forces of Labour, the Conservatives and the Liberal Democrats conspired against this, despite prior agreement in the case of the former two parties. This bill's reintroduction (with amendments due to the changed political system) is a red-line policy for us, and hope to win over the support of many new MPs. We additionally believe that Direct Democracy in its fullest sense should include People's Assemblies, where communities can call meetings to arrive at binding decisions when they feel local or national government has not done a sufficient job. This system would also allow the Government to canvas the opinion of a broad range of people when a consultation is needed, making use of randomness to avoid bias and reach a representative sample.</p>
				<p>It is also key to expand the franchise to British citizens overseas. British expats are dependent on the UK's foreign policy to ensure their continued residence and their British citizenship means that they can return and therefore be impacted by UK politics. It is therefore necessary to ensure that they are able to vote in general elections; this isn't even a radical policy, with many other countries having similar provision in place for their elections.</p>
				<p>On a more minor note, once people have bought a product it ought to be theirs to use freely. The Pirate Party is a proud supporter of free, libre and open-source software for this reason, and would introduce its use on all government systems (including use of GNU/Linux over Windows). We furthermore believe this purposes is served by the reduction of copyright terms to the minimum of 50 years required under the Berne convention - though we would also be in favour of renegotiating this deal to allow for further reduction.</p>
				<p>Moving once again to the bigger picture, devolution is a model that has worked well in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. Allowing these nations to pass their own laws and build their own legislation has meant that the people of these countries can choose their own paths. The Pirate Party UK supports further devolution to allow for more leeway, and in addition would support independence referenda (with the referenda themselves being free votes). In addition, we would seek to replicate this success by holding referenda on devolution to Cornwall and to Yorkshire. Both of these regions have had strong localist voices in recent years, and to refuse their demands would be to refuse the voice of the People itself.</p>
				<p>Within the UK, this municipalism can be built upon by the creation of English regional assemblies to empower local communities. These would spread across England, excepting Cornwall and Yorkshire should they accept a devolution settlement, and would have broad powers within their regions. the Pirates also call for the devolution of more powers to councils, including in the area of taxation, to enable more localised decisions to be made.</p>

				<h2>Providing good-quality healthcare</h2>
				<h1>SAVE LIVES</h1>
			</header>
			<content>
				<p><strong>The NHS, founded in 1946 under Clement Atlee and Nye Bevan, has provided good quality, free at the point of use healthcare for every person in the United Kingdom for the last 77 years. Further strengthening this societal safety net is something that the Pirates care deeply about, and we hope to build on this firm foundation in the next Parliamentary term.</strong></p>
				<p>The first priority is ensuring that this care is available in the areas it needs to be. One oft-made promise is that of a National Dental Service and the Pirate Party fully supports this. Dental care is an important aspect of healthcare and there is no reason people should have to pay for this necessity. Similarly, it is our belief that opticians and the provision of glasses should also come under the National Health Service, as they are likewise necessary parts of the lives of those who suffer from myopia or hyperopia. Furthermore, we would integrate care homes into a national system, and instate a review board to see where existing facilities are insufficient and to right this. Health and social care is a responsibility of the government from birth to death, and it is morally unjustifiable to force some of the most vulnerable to pay for their own continued survival because we do not care.</p>
				<p>But even more of a priority is the endless price-gouging committed by pharmaceuticals companies. The NHS is forced to pay through the roof for vital medications for millions, solely because rich multinationals don't want to part with a small fraction of their wealth. We would create a publicly-owned national pharmaceuticals company to supply the NHS with the life-saving drugs that so many need. As a result, we would also remove prescription fees and in so doing create a truly free NHS with not "hidden charges". Britain deserves a National Health Service that works for all and is truly free, unlike the existing system with regard to prescriptions.</p>
				<p>Even so, there remain groups for which certain aspects of the health system simply do not work. One of these aspects is that of euthanasia - while the Pirate Party maintains that the right to die peacefully is an important one, it is clear from schemes such as Canada's MAID that more oversight and protection against coercion are required to prevent abuses and effects that border on genocidal. Another system that does not work well is that of gender recognition - despite progress since 2014, trans people applying for a Gender Recognition still require either a report from a medical practitioner or to have begun or be intending to begin a medical transition. This needlessly medicalises the lives of trans people; we would instead propose an informed-consent model for both transgender health and gender recognition in order to ensure trans people are not unfairly discriminated against in this respect.</p>
				<p>There is also a fundamental need for a basic level of first aid knowledge among the general population - emergencies and accidents happen and it's important that the British public know what to do in these cases, as swift intervention can make the difference between life and death. The Pirate Party believes that first aid should be added to the curriculum, covering at a minimum CPR, covering wounds and how to use an epipen. This will reduce strain on health professionals and above all mean fewer deaths.</p>

				<h2>Ensuring the basics</h2>
				<h1>SAVE LIVES</h1>
			</header>
			<content>
				<p><strong>But while a strong health system is important, for many the biggest struggle to survive comes in finding the things they need the most. Millions go without the basics leading to hunger, thirst and homelessness, and in today's society this is simply unacceptable.</strong></p>
				<p>The first, and most crucial, need that any person needs to fulfil is the need for food. With the ongoing cost of living crisis, millions are unable to afford enough to provide for themselves and their families, leaving them deep in poverty. The Pirate Party would form a national supermarket chain, ensuring cheap prices, or perhaps free, for everyone and lifting families across the country over the breadline. Furthermore, we would create clothing shops so those on the lowest incomes can afford good quality clothes. No one should go without basics and we would put in place a detailed plan to ensure access.</p>
				<p>Additionally, access to banking is low in some areas and many cannot save money in any way other than the old-fashioned box of cash under the bed. Even worse, banks regularly play hard-and-fast with customers' savings, as exemplified by recent banking collapses in the US and elsewhere. The Pirate Party UK believes we should follow a suggestion from Yanis Varoufakis and provide all British citizens with bank accounts with the UK's central bank. This allows money to be held securely and safely, and also means that the Government is able to directly improve access to banking facilities by simply building more branches, rather than having to indirectly regulate the sector.</p>
				<p>On top of this, we believe in the right of all to have access to free and accessible transport. We believe public transport should be made completely free, both to alleviate pressure on the lowest-income households, and also to encourage a switch to less environmentally-damaging modes of transportation. Tied into this, we would nationalise Britain's mish-mash of bus networks, providing a single system which would simplify ticketing until we can abolish fares and provide a more unified experience for passengers. The current system, with private operators running just the profitable routes, results in rural regions having bus access cut off entirely or reduced to a nominal service. This would also help to meet the UK's bus frequency goals directly.</p>
				<p>One right that is held by everyone is the right to a home. Unfortunately, due to rising prices, decreasing stock, increasing numbers of houses bought-to-rent and the selling-off of council houses to landlords, home ownership is on the decline. We acknowledge the success of the ban on holiday homes where they are uninhabited, but the loophole to protect against this ban is renting homes rather than being forced to sell them. The Pirates support a French-style limit to the number of homes an individual can hold, including imposing this limit on companies.</p>
				<p>But what about when this aid doesn't work? Early Help systems are in place by some local authorities to provide assistance for families and young people before a situation becomes emergent, but these are often ineffective and unfortunately simply don't exist in many regions. As a result, support is patchy when the social safety net fails. Next term we intend to ensure that these Early Help Systems are available across the country and for more people, increasing access and outcomes for those who slip through the cracks.</p>

				<h2>Investing in knowledge</h2>
				<h1>BUILD A BETTER BRITAIN</h1>
			</header>
			<content>
				<p><strong>If we are to truly develop our country, beyond securing the basics, the most important thing to improve is our education system. Our country's children are its future and only by nuturing talent will we really make a difference to the world of tomorrow.</strong></p>
				<p>So where do we begin? The first step to improving our schools is to ensure we have enough teachers to guarantee a reasonable class size for everyone. To this end we will commit to a budget with a real-terms increase in teachers' wages. Encouraging more into the teaching profession will help the UK to reach its class size goals, enabling smaller and more targetted education. Additionally, it is clear that a review of the Ofsted system is due. It causes undue stress to headteachers and the ratings are in dire need of being reevaluated. To truly unlock students' potential we would review whether the school inspection system as it stands is adequate.</p>
				<p>There are also a number of changes we would make to the school curriculum to ensure that school leavers are well-rounded individuals, and that there are options for students of all learning styles. We would add logic and critical thinking as mandatory subjects, to provide Britons with a strong grounding for identifying fake news and analysing claims, as part of a general curriculum review. We would furthermore ensure that a vocational alternative to GCSEs, as it is clear that the inherently academic style of these qualifications just don't suit many pupils, who end up believing themselves to be "stupid" or "unintelligent". In truth, these students would learn better with a different teaching style and this is something that should be provided wherever possible.</p>
				<p>Those students with special education needs are also let down by the education system. Stifled by insufficient support and social stigma, young people with SEN face severe challenges in their learning and SENCO provision is often mediocre, if in place at all. The Pirate Party would review the availability of this provision and ensure a minimum level of support from fully-trained and qualified staff members. Everyone should have access to a good quality education regardless of who they are or what their background.</p>
				<p>But what about after 18? How should education continue into adulthood? Well, the first port of call for many after college, apprenticeships or university is to enter the world of work. In order to facilitate this shift, we would mandate that companies employ a percentage on "new-to-work" employees, ensuring that everyone can get that first rung on the ladder. Furthermore, some adults return to higher education later in life, and it is our belief that the government should pay for this learning. We would create a fund for this adult education, making sure everyone can learn no matter how old.</p>
				<p>It has also become clear that there is a need for an increased focus on languages teaching. While students abroad learn several languages, including English, the majority of students in the Britain do not progress past GCSE level in a modern language. This is compounded with the fact that many schools often only teach one or two languages, and almost always do not teach Welsh, Irish or Scots Gaelic. The Pirate Party recognises the importance of these languages and would encourage schools to teach a broader range of MFL subjects, providing additional funding for this where necessary.</p>

				<h2>Infrastructure for a brigher future</h2>
				<h1>BUILD A BETTER BRITAIN</h1>
			</header>
			<content>
				<p><strong>If we are to Chart a Course for a Brighter Future, it is clear that society will need the infrastructure to support whatever future we decide on - a strong industrial, cultural and economic backbone will propel Britain into the brighter future it deserves and ensure a better life for all Britons.</strong></p>
				<p>The first priority is good transport links. Strengthening logistical routes allows for future development to happen quicker and more easily while also allowing the freer movement of people and good around the country - improving social mobility and allowing increased access to opportunities even far across Britain. The Pirate Party is a proud believer in the efficacy of high speed rail, and we commit to the continuation of HS2 and HS3, as well as the electrification program designed to bring faster rail to the entire UK. We would also propose high-speed rail links to Cardiff and Edinburgh, as well as to Truro and York should their devolution referenda succeed. This will ensure that the devolved nations do not get left behind, something Westminster has often allowed to happen. In addition, we support a review into the feasibility of a Channel Tunnel-style project to Ireland in collaboration with the Irish government, extending to both Dublin and Belfast and allowing for cross-island transport without the need for polluting air travel. This would include an extension of the high-speed rail network from either the Cardiff or th Edinburgh lines, allowing for high-speed rail from Belfast to Gard du Nord.</p>
				<p>That's all very well for long-distance routes, but what about smaller, local services? London has long benefitted from its detailed and elaborate systems of Underground, Tramlink, DLR and the Elizabeth line, as well as an extensive bus network, and this is something we would like to see rolled out in many cities across the country. Light railway or tram systems can connect central locations with their suburbs, and provide a much-needed method for accessing jobs and services in the city center. Particular locations where we believe this would see the largest benefits include Birmingham and Manchester, both of which have considerable areas in which most work inside the main city itself rather than near their homes in what are effectively suburbs, meaning these rapid transit systems will allow for much quicker commutes. Buses are also a focal point of this plan, with their effectiveness being amply demonstrated by TfL. We would bring buses under public ownership, enabling better enactment of our service frequency goals, particularly in more rural areas.</p>
				<p>OK, but now how do we grow the British economy? The first step is to identify the UK's strengths and invest in them. The strongest parts of our economy are the service sector and the high-end manufacturing industry, with particularly fast-growing areas including aerospace and chemicals. We propose an evidence-based approach to economic growth, investing in those areas that will give us the largest returns whilst also encouraging growth in less-developed regions of the UK. This we hope will in turn encourage increased investment from the private sector into the British economy, allowing us to put the country back on track. Whether our investments be in the form of grants for startup companies, nationalisations of existing critical sectors or the subsidisation of development in key target areas, we hope to stimulate rapid growth in the UK.</p>

				<p>However, given the UK's highly specialised economy we continue to be heavily reliant on imports - Only 65% of our food consumption is domestically grown, for example, with the other 35% coming from overseas. This makes us dependant on strong links with our largest trading partners and, in particular, the free movement of goods between Britain and the countries we import the most from. As a result, any disruption to border checks, tariffs or regulatory compliance makes us more vulnerable to supply chain difficulties and resulting shocks to our economy. We would seek to ensure treaties with our strongest trading partners to facilitate this necessary trade and to ensure that our imports and exports are not being subjected to unfairly long-winded checks. This is particularly a problem for food and other perishables - by the time trucks have made it past the border, these have often gone off or are less fresh than they originally were. Specifically, we support the continuation of the move towards joining the Common Vetinary Area, simplifying checks on agricultural products such as milk or eggs and ensuring seamless trade. There are also several other deals that can be made with the European Union bringing some regulatory harmonisation and standards compliance.</p>
				<p>However, talk of Britain's manufacturing economy and imports fails to note the UK's cultural exports. Shows like Doctor Who and characters such as Sherlock Holmes are household names worldwide and British film, literature and music has spread around the globe. We would support several measures to further encourage this, most notably being the creation of a public film studio. This would create films that are available for everyone to watch for free, including for screening by cinemas, and would enable millions to access good-quality entertainment at the price of zero pounds. Furthermore, this studio would have an additional specific remit similar to that of Channel 4 to make unique and unconventional films that would be unlikely otherwise to gain funding, allowing a new generation of filmmakers to experiment with the medium. Regarding other cultural forms, the Pirate Party would reduce copyright to the minimum permitted by our international obligations, and would push for the renegotiation of these treaties. This will allow British creatives to build off of the work of others and make more of the weird and wonderful third-party spinoffs like Blood and Honey seen earlier this year. This sense of building on what has gone before is a key driver of creativity and this move towards lower copyright terms will help facilitate this.</p>
				<p>The BBC also plays a key role in this sharing of our cultural fruits, with the World Service letting people worldwide listen to British radio and enjoy the work of our publicly-owned national broadcaster. However, it is clear that the BBC is politically fragile, as funding could be threatened at any moment, essentially blackmailing the corporation for favourable press coverage. This is clearly unacceptable and so the Pirate Party would build on work done in the previous term to deliver a new Royal Charter for the BBC that grants it limited tax-raising powers, essentially nullifying this problem at least for the next ten years and guaranteeing journalistic independence. We would additionally seek to form a new public terrestrial broadcaster, dedicated to localist content and news and encouraging coverage of events that wouldn't otherwise make national news. </p>
