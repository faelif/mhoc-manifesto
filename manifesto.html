			<content>
				<strong>To the people of the Britain and Northern Ireland,</strong>
				<br  /><br  />
				The Pirate Party has now been operating for over a year, and we've come far. From our first elections's three seats to the thirteen we hold now we have experienced unparalleled success and have put this to good use improving the lives of the UK. 
				<br  /><br  />
				But there is much still to come. The Pirate Party's end goal is a society in which all are free not just from government abuse but from oppression of all kinds - from the discrimination faced by millions to the invisible hand of the market, we do not yet have true freedom. After a term of inaction and inequal economic policy it is clear that the same-old won't cut it, and it's clear that the solution is a radical rethinking of the ways in which we go about governing. Conservative values have shown themselves to be flawed and the People must say no to crushing austerity.
				<br  /><br  />
				This election we come to you with our view of the key next steps. By restoring confidence in the British economy and building it up to be green and climate-resilient we will open up thousands of jobs in green sectors and cause raises across the board, meaning more money in your pocket during a difficult cost of living crisis. But it is important that we do this in a manner that preserves democracy and transparency - no dodgy deals and backroom meetings; our motivation is nothing other the People's voice ringing true in our hearts and we promise to uphold your right to self-government and to know what we're doing at all times.
				<br  /><br  />
				I hope that after reading this manifesto you find yourself agreeing with this vision. On the 5th October the people of Britain face a choice as to whether you'd like more of the status quo or whether you want radical, decisive action to lift the country out of poverty, and I hope you find yourself voting for our bold new plan for government.
				<br  /><br  />

					<p>If we are elected to Government, we will be driven by five key missions intended to tackle the issues facing our country. These missions will be at the heart of any government in which we are elected to serve.</p>
					<p>We pledge to work tirelessly to:</p>
					<ol id="five-points-list">
						<li><strong class="bigger-font">Deliver economic security</strong>, by investing to create good jobs and growth in every part of the UK, alongside a stronger, fairer social safety net so that no one is left behind.
	</li>
						<li><strong class="bigger-font">Strengthen our public services</strong> by investing in and reforming the NHS, reshaping our education system to ensure young people have the skills they need to succeed, and making Britain’s streets safer by being tough on crime, and on the causes of crime.</li>
						<li><strong class="bigger-font">Invest in sustainable growth</strong> and green energy to make the UK a green tech superpower, alongside investing to ensure energy independence and protection from another winter energy crisis.
	</li>
						<li><strong class="bigger-font">Trust the British public</strong> by backing people power through devolution, local government and direct democracy.
	</li>
						<li><strong class="bigger-font">Bring back accountability</strong> and honesty to British politics by setting out clear promises and keeping to them, and making strong but responsible investments while supporting independent institutions like the OBR and Bank of England.
	</li>

				<h1>Delivering economic security</h1>
			</header>
			<content>
				<p>A key goal of any Pirate government will be to deliver long term economic security to the British people. This can only be delivered through more jobs, and a stronger system of social safety. We believe that every Brit should have the opportunity for a good quality, well paying job, and should be secure in the knowledge that whatever might happen, the social safety net will be there to keep them going.</p>
				<p>We believe in investing in the British economy, and the British public. Too often politicians have claimed that the responsible course of action is to asset strip Britain, to sell our economy short for a quick buck now. This is a con. In opposition we have stood up against the Bland Coalition and their attempts to sell off public infrastructure, and in Government we will ensure that public infrastructure is run for the public good, with profits reinvested into the country, rather than handed out to shareholders and vulture capitalists.</p>
				<p>At the core of our agenda will be what we call the Social Safety Net; this is the principle that everyone in the UK will be entitled to a minimum decent standard of living, with access to basic services at either free or affordable rates, and a minimum income model. We will consider access to basic utilities and services a human right, and fight for a Social Safety Net covering six key areas:
</p>
				<p><strong>FOOD</strong> - The Pirate Party is the party of the National Food Service, and it remains one of our proudest achievements. We will not support any budget that cuts it’s funding, and we will fight to ensure it can continue to do it’s vital work.</p>
				<p><strong>WATER</strong> - The water privatisation experiment has led to high prices and sewage in our rivers, we will re-nationalise water and make domestic water use free of charge, with fees only ever charged for excessive use. We will also seek to make the investments needed to modernise our water system.</p>
				<p><strong>ENERGY</strong> - Last winter the Pirates ensured that electricity prices remained the same as those seen before Putin’s invasion of Ukraine. We will reintroduce this scheme and ban all electricity cut-offs, while introducing legislation to ensure every household in Britain is insulated by 2030, starting with council housing and the poorest first.</p>
				<p><strong>INTERNET</strong> - The National Broadband Network plan cancelled by the Government would have seen £6bn a year in profit while improving competition and keeping prices down. We will reintroduce this policy and use the profits to deliver a free basic internet package to every household, alongside rolling out full-fibre to every household in the UK by 2030.</p>
				<p><strong>TRANSPORT</strong> - We will maintain our Fair’s Fare policy, which has transformed access to public transport in our country. We will also work to further improve access in those areas with only an hourly bus service.</p>
				<p><strong>INCOMES</strong> - The Pirate Party is the party of the Basic Income system. Basic Income rising with inflation will be a red line demand in any government in which we serve, we will also seek to go further and introduce legislation to have Basic Income increase month by month in line with the Consumer Price Index, rather than relying on annual increases to tackle inflation.</p>

				<p>Any Pirate Party budget will be one focused on using the tools of the Treasury to spread economic opportunity and reduce regional inequality. We believe in a redistributive state that levels up prosperity in all parts of our country.</p>
				<p>Under the Labour-Tory Bland Coalition, the public will pay more in shops to pay for a tax cut for the largest companies. We will work to undo the Government’s reckless corporate handout, this will bring £28bn back into the public purse, and we will use that money saved to not only cancel the reckless and damaging VAT rise, but also to create a new public sector investment fund, which will provide the kind of permanent and controlled annual investment needed to avoid another RAAC scandal before buildings start collapsing on our children’s heads.</p>
				<p>But we will also go further, cracking down on dodgy employers falsely claiming employees as self employed to ensure our tax system is tough but fair. While we have already introduced legislation to impose stricter rules on self employment status, we will go further, rolling out the proposed IR35 changes in full, alongside more comprehensive changes to tackle unethical tax avoidance. This will come alongside integrating Capital Gains Tax into Income Tax and abolishing non-domiciled status fully.</p>
				<p>We will also introduce comprehensive reform to councils' funding, making LVT a genuine council funding mechanism, and introducing a “solidarity fund” which will see portions of LVT raised in wealthier areas redistributed to poorer areas. This will ensure that poorer areas do not have to pay a higher tax bill in order to get the services they need and will help to reduce nation-wide inequality.</p>
				<p>These Council Funding reforms will come alongside a new push to turbocharge housebuilding. We will introduce mandatory housebuilding targets for all local authorities, and introduce a new publicly owned development company called “British Homes”, which will have new sweeping powers to purchase unoccupied land or mandate landowners to begin development. We will also introduce reforms to make the planning system more predictable and ensure that barriers to building are minimised.</p>
				<p>Finally, we will work urgently to expand pensions in the UK, recognising that currently people are simply not saving enough for a comfortable retirement. We will introduce legislation to mandate every employer to run a workplace pension scheme, which will be an opt out scheme where employers must match a minimum of 5% contributions. The Government will then add an additional bonus to further incentivise people to save. We will also introduce a Government run equivalent pension scheme for self-employed and unemployed people, which will operate on the same terms as Workplace Pensions.</p>

				<h1>Strengthening our public services</h1>
			</header>
			<content>
				<p>At the heart of any responsible Government is a stewardship for public services. For too long Governments have worried only for their limited six month period of administration, and not put investing for the future in the long term. This approach has utterly failed, and we are now seeing schools shut for fears of their roofs falling in.</p>
				<p>That is why we will ensure that long term investment in our public services is viewed as equally important as recruitment of new staff and purchase of new resources. In Government we already delivered a comprehensive plan to fully remove asbestos from our education system by rebuilding the majority of schools over the next ten years. We will go further and introduce a general public sector infrastructure and investment fund, paid for by the savings from cancelling the big business corporate tax cut.</p>
				<p>We will build on our legacy of supporting schools by proposing comprehensive reforms to education. Our current approach focuses too much on trivia and too little on life skills - we will make skills such as managing money and bills, getting a job and and participating in public life core components of our education system, and propose the wide changes to secondary education needed to achieve this. We will move away from an exam-focused system to one that rewards ongoing effort and learning actually valued in the workplace, and ensure that kids leave school with skills that they actually need.</p>
				<p>On healthcare, we will work to finally deliver an integrated Social Care system within the NHS, giving Integrated Care Commissions a statutory duty to administer care in their area, and providing the funding to deliver that goal. We will seek to transition towards a system where everyone will have access to a free at the point of use care system, with capacity to meet their needs. This is an urgent matter given our ageing population.</p>
				<p>We will couple this with a commitment to protect NHS funding, and inflation-lock it going forward. We will continue our established plans to push much more power on NHS management at the local level, with a goal to have as many decisions made at as local a level as possible. This will put doctors and clinicians in charge of care, not bureaucrats.</p>
				<p>We will also seek to strengthen NHS management at the local level. The NHS suffers from an approach in which doctors to act as administrators. Doctors spend half their time fighting with red tape, when these duties could be delegated to administrative staff, freeing up clinicians to get on with treatment. We will expand clinical staff while also providing for more dedicated administrative staff in NHS settings, meaning doctors will no longer need to waste their time on mountains of paperwork.</p>

				<h1>Strengthening our public services</h1>
			</header>
			<content>
				<p>The Pirate Party will be tough on crime, and tough on the causes of crime. Over recent years, British policing has shown itself to be suffering from serious systemic issues making it harder for honest bobbies to tackle crime. That is why we will fully implement the recommendations of Strategic Review of Policing and the Casey Review. Our policing system is built around a 20th century view of crime, and in the modern age it is failing both the police officers working within it, and the public at large. We will implement the structural reforms needed to let police get back to policing, with public confidence.</p>
				<p>We will also end the age of politicians overruling judges by restoring the Independent Sentencing Commission, which will be run by judges and will set out sentences that can effectively tackle crime, as well as produce effective rehabilitation. We believe that there are many crimes which simply aren’t being effectively deterred, and we believe that those particularly convicted of violent and sexual crimes should see tougher sentences, but having politicians deciding sentencing guidelines instead of an independent, judiciary lead body, is making it harder for that to happen.</p>
				<p>We also believe in an evidence led Criminal Justice System. As far back as 2001 the “Making Punishments Work” review told us that short prison sentences of six months or less increase the chance of rehabilitation, as they are just long enough to be disruptive to a person’s life, but not long enough to allow for meaningful rehabilitation. This alongside overcrowded prisons means that rather than reforming criminals, we have effectively allowed our prisons to become Crime Universities. For this reason we will introduce a mandate for the Independent Sentencing Commission to replace short sentences for nonviolent crimes with tougher community orders and restorative justice. This will both reduce recidivism and also ensure that criminals make amends to the communities they damage.</p>
				<p>The Pirate Party strongly believes that the privatisation of telecommunications has been mismanaged, with little understanding by the Government as to how it will deal with backhaul networks and the reduction in competition caused by it. If elected, the Pirates would work to reverse the botched privatisation and ensure free market competition and fibre access for everyone in Britain whether they live in the centre of London or the most far away island. Everyone deserves equal access to free market competition fostered through strong government investment and oversight, instead of the monopolised system introduced by the Grand Coalition.</p>

				<p>While in Government, the Pirate Party stepped up to the plate to deliver an Emergency Cost of Living strategy, after months of inaction by the previous right-lead administration. We are proud of the measures we put in place to bring down energy bills and save lives, but we want to do more to ensure that Britain has true energy independence and cannot suffer fuel price spikes under Putin’s jackboot ever again.</p>
				<p>We believe that through smart investment and a forward looking vision, the United Kingdom can become a Green superpower. We have some of the best natural resources for wind power in the world, and a sophisticated and high tech manufacturing industry that can deliver good jobs and energy security, ensuring we never have another winter energy crisis.</p>
				<p>We will invest £28bn a year into the green economy, working with private enterprises in partnership to create over a million high quality jobs across the United Kingdom. We believe in levelling up prosperity across the country, ending the regional divide and ensuring no part of the country is left behind. Through a smart and forward looking Green Prosperity Plan, we can ensure that everyone benefits from the opportunities provided by becoming a world leader in clean power, clean air and warmer homes - no one will be left behind through our plans.</p>
				<p>We believe that Great Britain can become the Green Tech capital of the world, and the envy of our neighbours. We will unleash the potential of British industry and manufacturing to deliver a green transition that creates tens of thousands of new jobs across the UK in gigafactories, clean steel plants, renewable-ready ports, green hydrogen and energy storage. These are the job creating industries of the future, and we want the UK to become a world leader in these fields. The UK has great capacity for specialist manufacturing and we hope to unlock this ability.</p>
				<p>We will also cut through the mountains of red tape holding back green energy infrastructure. It can take up to 13 years to develop new offshore wind, and planning controls mean that onshore wind is effectively banned. We will introduce legislation to make green energy generation a permitted development wherever an appropriate environmental impact assessment supports it, ending the town hall veto on green jobs.</p>
				<p>We will ensure implementation of legislation intended to set up a functioning “Great British Energy” company to manage our public energy infrastructure, and we will give that body a specific mandate to achieve full energy independence through renewables and nuclear by 2030. We will also introduce new legislation to ban cut-offs of electricity and gas to inhabited premises, so that no one will need worry about the lights going out if they can’t make ends meet.</p>
				<p>As we have said, we will also work to ensure the mass rollout of insulation across the country. The Pirate Party believes that more must be done to help people access insulation that will keep not only their bills down, but their homes warmer. We will set a statutory target to have every home in Britain insulated by 2030, and bring forward the fiscal firepower to get the job done.</p>

				<p>The Pirate Party is the party of localism and people power. We believe that decisions about local services are best made at the local level. Someone living in an area will have a far better understanding of its needs than a civil service busybody. That is why a key part of our agenda in Government will be helping communities to take back control, moving power from Whitehall to the town hall.</p>
				<p>The United Kingdom remains a place that is too centralised, too Westminster focused, and too often squanders the contributions of those in the regions and home nations of our great country. We recognise that the desire to leave the European Union was an outcry from a public who felt they had too little say in the policies shaping their lives. This is something we understand and recognise, despite as a party believing that Brexit was the wrong solution to that problem. That is why we will seek to legislate for a new "Take Back Control" bill, seeking to push more decision making powers to local people, as well as fundamentally reshaping Local Government to promote strong local voices to rebalance the United Kingdom's body politic away from the Westminster bubble.</p>
				<p>We believe that democracy should be a process, not an event. That is why we opposed the repeal of the Direct Democracy Enhancement Act. We will seek to make direct democracy a key mechanism for all levels of governance in the United Kingdom.</p>
				<p>It is no secret that the Pirate Party believes that the United Kingdom’s departure from both the European Union and Single Market has hurt our country, and undermined the peace process in Northern Ireland. We believe that democracy is a habit, not an event. A vote for the Pirate Party will always be a vote for closer ties with Europe, however we would not support rejoining the EU without a clear mandate at the ballot box, by either election or referendum.</p>
				<p>In the meantime, we will do all we can to limit the damage caused by Brexit. We firmly believe that people voting for Brexit were not voting to be poorer, more isolated and less secure. That is what the current flawed Brexit deal has delivered.</p>
				<p>That is why we want to conclude an ambitious new agreement with the EU to minimise barriers to British exporters. We will seek to enhance our cooperation with the EU on regulation, trade and the tackling of international crime and threats to our national security, as well as eliminate the need for the hard Irish Border.</p>
				<p>We also believe that worker representation should be viewed as a key part of our democracy, as vital as local and national elections and referenda. We have consistently fought against anti-union legislation, with our TULRA lifting numerous unfair legislative barriers to the legitimate activities of workers seeking to better their lot in life.</p>
				<p>If given the opportunity to serve in Government once more, we will look to substantially expand the freedoms of hard working Brits to unionise. We will also seek to reintroduce the Companies Act, to ensure that all large businesses in the UK have worker representation as a core part of the decision making process. While we do not believe anyone should be forced to join a union, we do believe that having every working person in Britain as a member of a union would be a good thing for society.</p>

				<h1>Bringing back accountability<h1>
			</header>
			<content>
				<p>The Pirate Party believe that society works best when a strong culture of honesty and transparency is fostered in public organisations. We believe that the public have a right to know what their government is doing, that sunlight is the best disinfectant for issues in our public services, and that if Britain is to be a success on the international stage partners and businesses across the world must know that politicians can be held to their word.</p>
				<p>It is unacceptable that Labour went from supporting the National Broadband Network to opposing it within six months. This is an example of the flip-flopping and inconsistency that has caused currency markets to begin to treat the United Kingdom like an emerging economy. If we are to see secure, sustainable growth, we must have consistentcy and clarity. A Pirate Government will seek to have consistency and clarity in everything we do, and to strengthen the trust the markets can have in our economic and political stability.</p>
				<p>For this reason, we will not only support the independence of the Bank of England and OBR as key pillars of our fiscal policy, but we will also introduce new legislation to ensure that no fiscal policy may come into force without the OBR having an opportunity to assess its likely impact. We will also expand the OBR’s mandate to consider not only the narrow fiscal impact of a policy, but it’s impact on social justice and public welfare. This will allow governments to think in terms of the public interest when costing its policies, avoiding another HS4 underfunding scandal.</p>
				<p>We will establishing a National Independent Commission Against Corruption (NICAC) with a jurisdiction over all councillors, members of parliaments, sitting peers, public servants, and employees of the state; the NICAC would have the power to prosecute those it finds guilty of corruption, hold public hearings and inquiries, and investigate accusations of corrupt conduct or proceedings on it’s own accord, without interference from those under investigation. We will couple this with strict new rules to prevent people leaving public life entering the lobbying world. It is a national scandal that ministers can seamlessly transition from for example working in the Health Department to working for companies that bid for NHS contracts, this is a clear conflict of interest and one we will legislate to prevent.</p>
				<p>We will also strengthen the Ministerial Code, which is the body of rules to which Ministers are expected to abide. While the codes of conduct for both civil servants and special advisers are set out in law, the Ministerial Code is merely based on convention, and can be withdrawn at any time by the Prime Minister. This is a clear conflict of interest, and one we will address by enshrining the Ministerial Code in statute, and legislating for an independent commission that may investigate breaches and apply sanctions directly to Ministers. This will ensure that those who abuse their office can be swiftly given the boot.</p>
				<p>And we will seek to protect those who cannot protect themselves, by ensuring the implementation of the Lords Final Report into Institutional Responses to Abuse, including a National Abuse Prevention Office with prosecution powers to ensure that institutional abuses of power against children and vulnerable adults do not go on unaccounted for.</p>
